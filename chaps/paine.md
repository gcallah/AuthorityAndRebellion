# Thomas Paine's Common Sense


"a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial
appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of
custom" (xi)

"Some writers have so confounded society with government,
as to leave little or no
distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have
different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our
wickedness; the former promotes our happiness *positively* by uniting our
affections, the latter *negatively*, by restraining our vices" (1).


"Here, then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode rendered
necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world; here too is the
design and end of government, viz. freedom and security" (4).

Of course, this is a made up origin: one of the great flaws of
Enlightenment-era thinkers, living as they did before
the great historical turn of the 19th
century, to imagine that they could create historical facts out of their own
speculations.


"But the constitution of England is so exceedingly complex, that the nation may
suffer for years together, without being able to discover in which part the
fault lies..." (5)


"There is something exceedingly ridiculous in the composition of monarchy; it
first excludes a man from the means of information, yet empowers him to act in
cases where the highest judgment is required. The state of a king shuts him
from the world, yet the business of a king requires him to know it thoroughly;
wherefore the different parts, by unnaturally opposing and destroying each
other, prove the whole character to be absurd and useless." (6)
