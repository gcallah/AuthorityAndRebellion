# Thoreau on Civil Disobedience

Thoreau claims that the ultimate conclusion to be drawn from "The government is
best which governs least" is that
"The government is best which governs not at all." (235)


He regards the American government as "a tradition... each instant losing some
of its integrity" (235).

"But, to speak practically, and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves
no-government men, I ask for, not *at once* no government, but at once a
better government"


"The mass of men serve the state, thus, not as men mainly, but as machines,
with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, genders,
constables, *posse comitatus*, etc." (237).


"All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right, to refuse
allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its
inefficiency are great and unendurable" (238). It is notable that here
Thoreau introduces a right to revolution against *inefficient* government.


"Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government,
yiekd to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters,
and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform... Why did they not
dissolve it themselves -- the union between themselves and the State -- and
refuse to pay their quota into its treasury?" (242)


"The authority of government is still an impure one: to be strictly, just, it
must have the sanction and consent of the governed. It can have no pure right
over my person and property, but what I concede to it. The progress from an
absolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a
progress toward a true respect for the individual... Is a
democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government? Is
it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the
rights of man? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until
the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power,
from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him
accordingly. I please myself with imagining a State at least which can afford
to be just to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor;
which even would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to
live aloof from it, not meddling with it, nor embraced by it, who fulfilled all
the duties of neighbors and fellow-men." (256)
