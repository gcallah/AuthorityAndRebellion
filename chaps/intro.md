# Introduction

## Gene Callahan and Leye Komolafe

There is a centuries-long conversation in Anglo-American political thought, with a rich history, on the nature and
justification of state authority. The history of this conversation includes towering intellectual figures such as
Shakespeares and Hobbes, as well as dramatic events such as the "three English revolutions."

At a time of renewed turmoil as to the obligations we have to our states, a deep dive into this history may prove
salutary.
