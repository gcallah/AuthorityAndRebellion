# Introduction

## Gene Callahan and Leye Komolafe

There is no doubt that questions such as “when is state authority justified?” and “when we are obligated to obey the state?” have received perennial attention in philosophy, even as the subjects stretch back to as far as Plato’s dialogues. In the same vein, the limits of state authority or the possibility of rebellion has also been conceptualized within the philosophical tradition. How is a move from the ontological individuality of persons to the organization of the state possible? How is the formation of the state a leap from individual autonomy? Is there a justification for the leap from individuality to accepting the state’s exercise of authority? What binds subjects to the state in relation to obligation? How is authority exercised by the state, and are there limitations to it? To what extent can state authority be justified, and how does, or can, rebellion arise? Is rebellion a condition for checking the excesses of the state, or is rebellion a critical category that raises fundamental question about non-justification of state authority under any guise? What would count as conditions for the rejection of authority? Is rebellion permissible or is it inevitable? These and several other questions are pertinent in interrogating the notions of authority and rebellion. 

In the history of western philosophy, different intellectual leanings permeate thoughts around the subject of authority and rebellion. Some thinkers are inclined towards the theocentric perspective, which states that the source of authority is God, while others attempt to provide different grounds for the notion. It is safe, for instance, to claim that the Enlightenment project, which principally deviates from the theocentric view, and implicitly advocates autonomy, is the source of a series of contractarian theories for authority. With the growth and influence of the Enlightenment tradition also, consent becomes the precondition for authority in the contractarian framework. Furthermore, it could be argued that the logic of consent-based view of authority is that only an established agreement between political subjects can stricto sensu count as authority. In essence, therefore, contractarians are convinced that individuals are imbued with rational capacities, and that any attempt to subvert their consent to political constitution, would undermine the possibility of exercising authority over them. Subsequently, consent-inclined conceptualization of authority led to the development of modern democracy and continues to shape its practice. 

Historically, notions such as theocracy, the diving rights of kings, authoritarianism, oligarchy, totalitarianism, and others have been subjected to philosophy scrutiny and theorizations in western philosophy. Similarly, whether the theoretical construction of consent is a necessary and sufficient condition for authority has also become a significant bone of contention in contemporary philosophical discourses, specifically within the democratic outlook. 

There is a centuries-long conversation in Anglo-American political thought, with a rich history, on the nature and
justification of state authority. The history of this conversation includes towering intellectual figures such as
Shakespeares and Hobbes, as well as dramatic events such as the "three English revolutions." At a time of renewed turmoil as to the obligations we have to our states, a deep dive into this history may prove
salutary. 

In this book, therefore, attempts would be made to trace the historical and intellectual development of authority and rebellion in Anglo-American political thought from the writings of numerous intellectual figures whose works are relevant to the discourse. Genealogical accounts of state formation, the development of authority, and the justification or non-justification of rebellion will also be thoroughly interrogated within the Anglo-American political thought in philosophy.
